### Concept
In the VFX production environment, artists often face decreased productivity and increased fatigue due to the complexities of setting up workflows and managing files. **Moomins API** was developed to address these issues by providing an automation tool that integrates with Shotgun, significantly reducing project setup time and improving convenience. The goal is to create a more comfortable work environment for artists, enabling them to work more effectively and efficiently.
- **Project Setup Automation**: Reduce the time required for artists to set up projects.
- **Integration with Shotgun**: Enhance the efficiency of project management.
- **Maximize Workflow Efficiency**: Provide an environment where artists can focus on creative work.

### **Shotgun Workflow Automation**
- **Task and Status Auto-Sync**: Automatically sync assigned tasks and statuses with the Shotgun database in real-time to ensure up-to-date information.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Reflect progress accurately with real-time updates from the Shotgun database.
- **Version Control Integration**: Simplify version management by integrating it into the loader through right-click options.
- **Automatic File and Folder Creation**: Automate the creation of files and folders upon program execution, including updates to the Shotgun database for efficient workflow management.
